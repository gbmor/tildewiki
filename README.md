# TildeWiki [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gbmor/tildewiki)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gbmor/tildewiki) [![Travis CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/gbmor/tildewiki.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gbmor/tildewiki)
TildeWiki is a memory-caching static site server. The possible uses of TildeWiki range from blogs to wikis, and more.
Let me know if you adapt it to a new use-case, I'm always interested!

Originally designed around the needs of the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org).<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

## [v0.6.4](https://github.com/gbmor/tildewiki/releases/tag/v0.6.4)
Version 0.6.4 Changes:
* Cleaned up code so it's nicer to read. Less extraneous whitespace, unnecessary comments, etc.
* Refactored index and page cache a bit

### Currently powering the [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute) wiki: 
* [https://wiki.tilde.institute](https://wiki.tilde.institute) 
* [gtmetrix report](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/wiki.tilde.institute/F1tzxEch)

## <a name="features"></a>Features
* Speed is a priority
* Mobile-friendly pages
* Markdown!<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
* Compressed responses (gzip)
* Uses [kognise/water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) dark theme by
default (and includes as an example, a simple but nice local CSS file)<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
* `YAML` configuration
* Automatically reloads config file when a change is detected.
* Generates list of pages, then places at an anchor comment in the index page
* Caches pages to memory and only re-renders when the file changes
* Very configurable. For example:
  * URL path for viewing pages
  * Directory for page data
  * File to use for index page
  * Logging output (file, `stdout`, `null`) and file location
* Runs as a multithreaded service, rather than via CGI
* Easily use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) or Nginx to proxy requests to it. This allows you to use your
existing SSL certificates (or, in the case of Caddy, painlessly generate new ones).

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

The installation script uses `bash`, and the startup script uses `daemonize`. Both should
be available in any Linux distribution's package repositories. However, they are not
required to use TildeWiki.

### Using the scripts

First, clone the repository or download and untar a release archive, then enter the directory.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/gbmor/tildewiki.git && cd tildewiki

$ curl -L https://github.com/gbmor/tildewiki/archive/v0.6.3.tar.gz | tar xzvf - && cd tildewiki-v0.6.3
```

If you used `git`, the master branch will be the most recent release. Development work stays
in the `dev` branch, so there's no need to look for a tag.

Execute `setup.sh` as root, with the `install` argument:

```
$ sudo ./setup.sh install
```

Once you receive the confirmation message, and no errors have appeared, you may run the
startup script as root to test the installation:

```
$ sudo tildewiki
```

TildeWiki will drop privileges to the `tildewiki` user, which was created by the script.

I'm going to add a `systemd` service file soon. For now, it'll need to be started like this.

### Building manually

If you prefer, you can install it this way. Clone the repository or download a source archive
like above, and enter the directory. Once in the directory, you'll need to build the binary.

```
$ go build
```

It won't take long. Also, it doesn't need to live in your `GOPATH` as
it's been set up to use Go Modules.

After it finishes, you can leave the binary where it is or move it somewhere else. Remember
to move the `pages` and `assets` directories with it, along with `tildewiki.yaml`.

### Setting up TildeWIki

Begin by combing through `tildewiki.yaml` (if you used the scripts, it's in `/usr/local/tildewiki`)
and changing the options to something appropriate to your site. Afterwards, place your markdown-formatted
pages into the directory specified by `PageDir` in the config and place your markdown-formatted 
index file, containing the anchor comment `<!--pagelist-->`, into the `AssetsDir`. Feel free to
change the favicon and CSS to your liking.

Once that's all done, either run `/usr/local/bin/tildewiki` (if you've used the scripts) or run
the binary manually.

### Serving TildeWiki

Unless you plan on serving directly from :8080 (which is fine!), or whichever port you chose in 
`tildewiki.yaml`, I recommend proxying requests to TildeWiki so it can be served from a subdomain,
for example. There are several options for this, namely [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and 
[nginx](https://nginx.org). The best option is for you to use Caddy: it integrates TLS certificate 
renewal and has a *very* easy configuration syntax.

If you're going to use Nginx, here's an example server block for you to start with. Note: this 
example uses TLS and http2. [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is awesome, and free. 
Their `certbot` tool is really easy to use.

```
server {
    server_name wiki.example.com;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    listen 0.0.0.0:443 ssl http2;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/wiki.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/wiki.example.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}
server {
    if ($host = wiki.example.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
    listen 80;
    server_name wiki.example.com;
    return 404;
}
```

* Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04LTS, Debian 9, 10, and Sid) and OpenBSD 6.4

1. <a name="1"></a>For [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org) projects, we tend to use a PR
workflow for collaboration. For example, wiki pages are submitted to the repo via pull
request. I'm currently evaluating other options for page creation and editing.

2. <a name="2"></a>Uses a patched copy of [russross/blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday)
([gopkg](https://gopkg.in/russross/blackfriday.v2)) as the markdown
parser. The patch allows injection of various `<meta.../>` tags into
the document header during the `markdown->html` translation.

   * The patched `v2` repository lives at:
[gbmor-forks/blackfriday.v2-patched](https://github.com/gbmor-forks/blackfriday.v2-patched)
   
   * The patched `master` repo lives at:
