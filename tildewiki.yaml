# CHANGING THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS NECESSITATES A RESTART ############

# The port for the service to bind to.
# Tildewiki will bind to localhost.
Port: "8080"

# Change to true to have nothing display after the initial
# start-up messages
QuietLogging: false

# Change to true to have all messages beyond the initial
# start-up go to a file. The name is either relative to
# the executable or absolute. If QuietLogging is set,
# nothing will be written to the file.
FileLogging: false

# THE REST OF THE OPTIONS DON'T REQUIRE A RESTART ##################

# Minimum time between cache refreshes for the index page
# Should be a typical time string: 30m, 60s, 10s, etc.
# This is to rate-limit how often TildeWiki has to read
# the index file and pages directory
IndexRefreshInterval: "30s"

# The name of the wiki
Name: "Tildewiki"

# Used in the <title> tag between name and description

# Like the `index` markdown document (front page), the error pages,
# the icon / favicon, etc.
AssetsDir: "assets"

# Use the file name, not the full path

# Regex to validate the URLs. You probably don't want to change this.
ValidPath: "^/(w)/([a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)$"

# URL path used to delineate the wiki pages.
# The default is "w", which would appear publicly as:
